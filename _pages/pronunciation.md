**TLDR: "john-how pong" or simply "zen-how pen".**

Peng (彭) is my family name. It is hard to pronounce in English.
The most similar analogies are _Pong_ or _Pung_.
English speaker might pronounce like _Pain_.

Zhenghao (正皓) is my given name with two Chinese characters.
It sounds very similar to _john-how_. The instinct of an English speaker might
pronounce _zen-how_.

I also have a Starbucks name _Mark Peng_.
