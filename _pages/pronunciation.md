**TLDR: "john-how pong" or simply "zen-how pen".**

Peng (彭) is my family name. It is hard to pronounce in English.
The most similar analogies are *Pong* or *Pung*.
English speaker might pronounce like *Pain*.

Zhenghao (正皓) is my given name with two Chinese characters.
It sounds very similar to *john-how*. The instinct of an English speaker might
pronounce *zen-how*.

I also have a Starbucks name *Mark Peng*.
