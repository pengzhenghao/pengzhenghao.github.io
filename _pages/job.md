### What I look for in a team

1. **Clear agenda & shared values**: I enjoy in teams united by a mission and work together for a common goal.

2. **Positive societal impact**: I want to build robots that benefit the well-being of everyone, poor or rich, west or east.

3. **Open-minded, truth-seeking collaboration**: I value environments where ideas are debated constructively, assumptions are challenged---once common ground is established, we all work together to make it happen.

4. **Longtermism**: We need to look ahead and think how robot would be like in 100 years later and how we can do now to foster that future.
