Hi there! I’m a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io). 
Before UCLA, I earned my MPhil in the Multimedia Lab at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my Bachelor’s at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.


I am building agents that can reason about the world, align with human intent, and adapt in real time. 
Over the past 7 years, I’ve explored a wide spectrum of agent learning techniques: multi-agent RL, human-in-the-loop learning, and large-scale training.

**Goal:** Physically-grounded, aligned and versatile robots.

**Method:** 
Imitation learning pretraining, 
closed-loop finetuning, and
human-in-the-loop test-time adaptation.

##### Please check out my **[research statement](research)** for more details.

I believe in:

* **Clear agendas & shared values**: I thrive in mission-driven teams working toward a common goal.
* **Positive societal impact**: I want to build robots that benefit everyone — rich or poor, East or West.
* **Open-minded, truth-seeking collaboration**: I value environments that welcome debate, challenge assumptions, and unite to execute once aligned.
* **Longtermism**: Let’s build the kind of robots that will be welcomed a hundred years from now — and do the work now that enables that future.

**I'm currently on the job market** — if you’re working on the future of embodied AI, let’s chat!

Why you need to hire me?

1. I am an expert in RL. I've been doing and teaching RL for 7 years. I've worked on a various spectum of agent learning problems: multi-agent RL, human-in-the-loop learning, and large-scale RL.
2. I am a robotics enthusiast. I like building things that you can interact with. I have insights on what to do next: physically grounded AI, new VLA architecture that supports both system 1 fast reaction and system 2 deep thinking.
3. I am a skilled programmer. I've built a driving simulator that has be widely used in the community. Checkout my github commit history.
4. I am a good communicator and I am a good team member.

What I want from the team?

1. I want the team to have a clear agenda and core values. I enjoy working with others who share the same vision and values, even though I am not the first author somewhat.
2. I want the robot we built benefits the majority. Robots that deprive people of their jobs, or robots that are not safe to use, are not the robots I want to build.
3. I want the team to be open-minded and inclusive. I want to work with people who are willing to listen to different opinions and ideas, and who are not afraid to challenge the status quo.
