Hi there! I’m a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io). My work sits at the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning, and vision–language–action models — building agents that can reason about the world, align with human intent, and adapt in real time.

Before UCLA, I earned my MPhil in the Multimedia Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and my Bachelor’s at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Along the way, I’ve explored how human feedback, large-scale RL, and foundation models can bring us closer to physically capable, trustworthy AI systems.

**I'm currently on the job market** — if you’re working on the future of embodied AI, let’s talk.

**Goal:** Physically-grounded, aligned and versatile robots.

**Method:** A VLM is not naturally a VLA. A VLA is not naturally a brain of robot. Capacity building for embodied understanding, decision-oriented thinking, and agile yet reasoned action-making.

### Why hire me?

1. **Reinforcement Learning expertise**: 7 years of research and teaching in reinforcement learning, spanning multi-agent RL, human-in-the-loop learning, and large-scale training.

2. **Robotics Vision**: Passionate about building interactive, physically grounded AI; designing VLA architectures that combine System 1 fast reaction with System 2 deep reasoning. Worked with quadruped robot, delivery robot and unmanned surface vehicle.

3. **Proven Programmer**: Created a widely used driving simulator in the research community. (See my [GitHub](https://github.com/pengzhenghao) and [MetaDrive](https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive))

4. **Strong communicator & teammate**: Experienced in cross-disciplinary work, clear technical writing, and team-driven innovation.

### What I look for in a team

1. **Clear agenda & shared values**: I enjoy in teams united by a mission and work together for a common goal.

2. **Positive societal impact**: I want to build robots that benefit the well-being of everyone, poor or rich, west or east.

3. **Open-minded, truth-seeking collaboration**: I value environments where ideas are debated constructively, assumptions are challenged---once common ground is established, we all work together to make it happen.

4. **Longtermism**: We need to look ahead and think how robot would be like in 100 years later and how we can do now to foster that future.

<!--
Why you need to hire me?

1. I am an expert in RL. I've been doing and teaching RL for 7 years. I've worked on a various spectum of agent learning problems: multi-agent RL, human-in-the-loop learning, and large-scale RL.
2. I am a robotics enthusiast. I like building things that you can interact with. I have insights on what to do next: physically grounded AI, new VLA architecture that supports both system 1 fast reaction and system 2 deep thinking.
3. I am a skilled programmer. I've built a driving simulator that has be widely used in the community. Checkout my github commit history.
4. I am a good communicator and I am a good team member.

What I want from the team?

1. I want the team to have a clear agenda and core values. I enjoy working with others who share the same vision and values, even though I am not the first author somewhat.
2. I want the robot we built benefits the majority. Robots that deprive people of their jobs, or robots that are not safe to use, are not the robots I want to build.
3. I want the team to be open-minded and inclusive. I want to work with people who are willing to listen to different opinions and ideas, and who are not afraid to challenge the status quo.
