Hi there! I am a 3rd year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles, and is supervised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io).
Before moving to UCLA, I already worked with Prof. Zhou and conducted researches for years and earned my MPhil degree in the Multimedia Lab at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests cover multi-agent behavior modeling and human-in-the-loop agent learning. 
Hope you enjoy my works!
